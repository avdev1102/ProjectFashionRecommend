Developed a fashion recommendation system using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Streamlit. The
application leverages ResNet50-based feature extraction and color histograms to match clothing items, generating personalized
outfit recommendations based on user-selected gender, usage, and color preferences. Implemented k-NN for similarity search to
suggest visually cohesive outfits.
